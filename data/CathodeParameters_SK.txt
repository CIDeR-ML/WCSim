# First line is: photocathode_model_choice cathode_thickness number_of_cathode_points
# photocathode_model_choice: 0 = default model, 1 or 2 = new models
# "1" is copied from geant4.11, which is based on https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9875513
# Model the alloy as a thin layer with real refractive index, then calculate reflection and transmission probability
# Cannot handle total internal reflection when n1<n2
# "2" is implemented based on https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0408075v1
# Model the alloy as a thin layer with real and imaginary refractive indices, then calculate absorption, reflection and transmission probability
# cathode_thickness: unit = nm
# number_of_cathode_points: number of points to read refractive indices
# each subsequent line is: photon_energy_in_eV refractive_index_real refractive_index_imaginary
